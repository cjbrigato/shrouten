shroutening urls since we forgot everything about golang

### What *Shrouten* stands for ?

*shrouten* is willful misspelling of the word "shorten".

Shrouten was created as a short material for an SRE job interview. 

It was meant to be a *further step* from a barebone url shortener, to demonstrate early idiomatic implementation of what Golang eventually provides for helping agnosticism in programming. Main goal was transforming specific backends code to possible agnostic interfaces, and discuss around these concepts.

For a real "barebone" url minifier relying on golang's standard library only, https://github.com/nickvellios/Golang-URL-Minifier/tree/master/src/tiny was taken as reference.

### Glossary of on purpose Typos

As "shrouten" was willful typo made as metaphor for the dangling state of the writer regarding recollecting past Golang knowledge, there are a few others of these in the code, left as humoristic note and wording consistency.

To avoid any doubt regarding their willfulness, here is the list these typos. If one is not in this list, then, you got it, *it is an actual typo.*

*shrot*: root word and intrinsic purpose of shrouten, stands for *short*.

*shroutenable*: any thing that is used as candidate for shroutening. Upon invalidation, it could lose it's state of shroutenable. Please note that *General* *Shroutenability*  and associated theory is a wider and more complex topic which is not covered here.

*errur*: a common thing that is reputed to be "human" and that humanity tries it's best to avoid. Stands for *error*. Denoted as *"Intrenol errur"* when happening at lower levels.

*suczfullness*:  second triggered consequence of former said failure for ECC to handle writer's thought, resulting in partially corrected word. Stands for *successfulness*.
